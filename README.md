 # GuessTheNumber by Petrow

**Guess The Number** is a **basic console game** where you need to guess the hiden number, which you opponent (the computer) has come up with. When the program is started your task is to write numbers until you guess the hiden one which is between **1 and 100**.
Each time when you enter a number, the program will give you a **hint**, depending on whether the number is greater or less than the expected.
**Everything is very simple, enjoy :)**
